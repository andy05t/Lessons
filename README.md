# School_timetable program
This is a program which takes in the teacher's name, what subject they teach and for how many hours, and sorts that information into a table to complete the ideal timetable for 6 classes. The maximum number of hours a teacher can work without interfering with other subjects or an already existing lesson is 80 hours a month (20 hours a week). Therefore, 20 hours is the maximum limit a teacher can work for. The timetable is only done for one week, as in the specifications it is implied that the timetable does not change during the month.
Also, as stated in the specifications, Maths and Physics are the top priorities, meaning that they get filled in first, before any other subject.
